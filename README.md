# Frontend Workshop 2024-02

In this repository, you will find a number of problems. How many you find is up to you.
Some of the problems will lead to other problems.

When you think you've found everything, DM me and I'll join your breakout room.
We'll do a quick code review and I'll let you know if you're on the right track,
if you've found everything, or if you have more work to do.

## What should the application do?

This application is a tricorder searching for lifeforms! Once it's found the appropriate
number of lifeforms (we want exactly 47 lifeforms found!), it should indicate success.
